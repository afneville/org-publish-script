#+TITLE: Personal Website Source Code

This repository contains the full source code for [[https://alexneville.co.uk][my personal website]]. The content is written in a markdown-like syntax called /Org/; these files have the extension =.org=. On its own, /Org/ is an intuitive plain text syntax, but it is more useful than markdown due to the rich support offered by [[https://orgmode.org/][org mode]] for /Emacs/.

** Build

To build a version of the site with the current repository contents, recent versions of both /GNU Emacs/ and /org mode/ are required:

#+begin_src text
emacs >= 28.1
org   >=  9.0
#+end_src

The export script will build the site under =out/html/=.

#+begin_src sh
chmod u+x export.sh
./export.sh
#+end_src
