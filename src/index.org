Hello, my name is Alex. I am a first-year undergraduate Computer Science student at the University of Birmingham in the UK. I am currently learning about programming and software engineering, focusing on the C, C++ and Python languages. I am particularly interested in /Free and Open Source/ software and I am learning to use Linux and some of the core Unix utilities at the same time.
