Hello, my name is Alex. I am a first-year undergraduate computer science student at the University of Birmingham, UK. I am particularly interested in /Free and Open Source/ software. My preferred languages are C, Python and lately C++. I am currently learning to use Linux and GNU, and some of their common free alternatives, more effectively.
